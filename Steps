Steps referred from RG:
For running ADT, you should be following next steps:
1- Make sure that if python 2.5 installed on your PC: you can download it from the following URL:
https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/
2- install Autodock tools: you can download it at:
http://autodock.scripps.edu/downloads/autodock-4-2-x-installation-on-windows/
3- install mgltools:
http://mgltools.scripps.edu/downloads
After having finished installation of above tools, you can run ADT. Here, I recommend you to following my current protocol for running it:
1- create a workfolder for your job and tag it based on your favorite name. (e.g. project)
2- running ADT in start menu in windows:
after running you should set its directory: following these steps:
a) open ADT> File> Preferences>set> Startup Directory (in this section you should put on your workfolder path and set it). for example: “C:\Users\project
3- prepare ligand and protein in ".pdb" format. Notice, you must labeled them by "Ligand" and "Protein" keywords.
after having finished these steps you can run ADT: Well! you should do the below ways:
1- open ADT:
File > Read Molecule> Select Protein File (“.pdb” file)
Then:
Edit > Hydrogens >Add>>>>>> Polar Only >OK
Edit > Hydrogens> Merge Non Polar >  Continue (in this step if you see any warning please click on "continue")
then:
Edit > Charges > Add Kolman Charges> Ok
File > Save > Write PDB> >Sort Nodes (Check) > OK > (Overwrite) YES
Well! in the next step you should try prepare the ligand:
Ligand > Input > Open> Select Ligand File (“.pdb” file) > OK
Now repeat above steps and then: (in this section you must add charge to your ligand. So, click on Edit menu and:
Edite> Charges> compute Gasteiger
Ligand > Output > Save as PDBQT
******************************
Now you should be executing AutoGrid4:
For run AutoGrid following the below steps:
1-Grid > Macromole > Choose>  Click (Protein) > Select Molecule > OK > save
2-Grid> Set Map types >Choose Ligand> Click (Ligand) > Select Ligand
3-Grid > GridBox> Set the BOX> File > Close Saving Current
4-Grid > Output > Save GPF> grid.gpf> save
5-Run > Run AutoGrid:
a) Select Program Pathname: ‘autogrid4.exe’ (i.e. C:\Program Files (x86) \The Scripps Research Institute\Autodock\4.2.6)
b) Select Parameter Filename: ‘grid.gpf’ (you should select it based on your workfolder path)
c) Launch!
Notice! in this step you must waiting for ADT response. please don't "dismiss" it!
***************************************************************
After having finished above steps following the below ways:
Run ADT:
1)Docking > Macromolecule > Set Rigid filename> Select ‘Protein.pdbqt’ > Open
2-Docking > Ligand > Choose> Click ‘Ligand’ > Select Ligand> Accept
3-Docking > Search Parameters > Genetic Algorithm> Accept
4-Docking > Output > Lamarckian GA> Save file as ‘dock.dpf’
5-Run > Run AutoDock 
A) Select Program Pathname: ‘autodock4.exe’ (C:\Program Files (x86)\The Scripps Research Institute\Autodock\4.2.6)
B) Select Parameter Filename: ‘dock.dpf’ (Based on you workfolder path)
C) Launch!
Please wait for finishing and don't dismiss it!!
***********************************************************
Docking result analysis:
1-Analyze > Docking > Open> Select ‘dock.dlg’ > Open >Assign Ligand New Name > OK
2-Analyze > Macromolecule > Choose> Click ‘Protein’ > Select Macromolecule
3- Analyze > Conformations> Play, Ranked By Energy > Click on the ‘&’ Button
4-Set Play Options >Check ‘Build H-Bonds’> View the hydrogen bonds formed > Check ‘Show Info’> View the Interaction Energy > Build Current Write Complex> Save as ‘Result.pdb’ ” Save....
Now you can see all of your docking results!
